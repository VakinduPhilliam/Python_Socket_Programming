# Python Socket Programming
This series of scripts is written to demonstrate the process of Python Socket Programming. 

Of the various forms of Inter Process Communication (IPC), sockets are by far the most popular.

The combination of sockets with INET makes talking to arbitrary machines around the world unbelievably easy. 

The client application (your browser, for example) uses “client” sockets for client-server communication; the web server it’s talking to uses both “server” sockets and “client” sockets.
